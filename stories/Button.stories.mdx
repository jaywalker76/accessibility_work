# Button
Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.
A button is a widget that enables users to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an action, or performing a delete operation. A common convention for informing users that a button launches a dialog is to append "…" (ellipsis) to the button label, e.g., "Save as…".

A button can receive **Phrasing Content**, but no **Interactive Content** is allowed




In addition to the ordinary button widget, WAI-ARIA supports 2 other types of buttons:
- Toggle button: A two-state button that can be either off (not pressed) or on (pressed). To tell assistive technologies that a button is a toggle button, specify a value for the attribute aria-pressed. For example, a button labelled mute in an audio player could indicate that sound is muted by setting the pressed state true. Important: it is critical the label on a toggle does not change when its state changes. In this example, when the pressed state is true, the label remains "Mute" so a screen reader would say something like "Mute toggle button pressed". Alternatively, if the design were to call for the button label to change from "Mute" to "Unmute," the aria-pressed attribute would not be needed.
- Menu button: as described in the menu button pattern, a button is revealed to assistive technologies as a menu button if it has the property aria-haspopup set to either menu or true.

### When to use
Use buttons to communicate actions users can take and to allow users to interact with the page. Each page should have one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons.

### When not to use
Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

### Phrasing Content 

Defines the text and the mark-up it contains. Runs of phrasing content make up paragraphs.
Elements belonging to this category are:
```<abbr>, <audio>, <b>, <bdo>, <br>, <button>, <canvas>, <cite>, <code>, <command>, <data>, 
<datalist>, <dfn>, <em>, <embed>, <i>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <kbd>, <keygen>, <label>, <mark>, 
math>, <meter>, <noscript>, <object>, <output>, <picture>, <progress>, <q>, <ruby>, <samp>, <script>, 
<select>, <small>, <span>, <strong>, <sub>, <sup>, <svg>, <textarea>, <time>, <var>, <video>, <wbr> 
and plain text (not only consisting of white spaces characters)
```

A few other elements belong to this category, but only if a specific condition is fulfilled:
```
<a>, if it contains only phrasing content
<area>, if it is a descendant of a <map> element
<del>, if it contains only phrasing content
<ins>, if it contains only phrasing content
<link>, if the itemprop attribute is present
<map>, if it contains only phrasing content
<meta>, if the itemprop attribute is present
```
